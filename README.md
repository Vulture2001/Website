This repository contains the documentation website for the **Software 5.0 Framework**, developed as part of the Master’s thesis:

> **Integrating Social and Ecological Sustainability in Software Product Development**  
> Technical University of Munich  
> Author: *Monika Zielińska (2025)*

## 🎯 Purpose

Software has a **dual role in sustainability**:  
it can enable responsible innovation, but it can also reinforce ecological and social challenges.  
Yet, sustainability is still **marginally embedded** in software engineering education and practice.

The **Software 5.0 Framework** addresses this gap by providing:
- Practical **methods**
- Ready-to-use **templates**
- Guidance for **embedding social and ecological sustainability** in software projects

This website serves as the **documentation hub** for the framework.
