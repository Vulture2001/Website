## Introduction

Theory is one thing — practice is another. In the **iPraktikum course at TUM**, student teams collaborated with real clients to design and develop working software in one semester. Alongside technical goals, they applied sustainability methods such as the **Systemic Journey Map** and **Inclusive Segment Groups**.

Their reflections highlight how sustainability can shape real development work — and where gaps still exist.

## What Students Found Valuable

    items={[
        { title: "Raising awareness early", body: "The tools helped students recognize that even small design choices ripple outward into ecological and social effects." },
        { title: "Making impacts visible", body: "Mapping environmental and social consequences gave structure to topics that are often overlooked." },
        { title: "Supporting teamwork", body: "Methods like Inclusive Segment Groups sparked discussion about accessibility, fairness, and representation." }
    ]}
/>

Students appreciated how the methods added **new perspectives** without replacing familiar agile practices. They made sustainability a topic of conversation at design meetings and client check-ins.

## Challenges Students Faced

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Ecological reasoning was harder", body: "While students could imagine social effects (e.g., inclusivity, fairness), ecological impacts often remained abstract or limited to energy use." },
        { title: "Confidence gap", body: "Even when they identified impacts, many students felt unsure about how to turn these insights into concrete backlog items or code-level changes." },
        { title: "Course pressure", body: "Tight timelines and client deliverables made it tempting to push sustainability topics aside in favor of immediate features." }
    ]}
/>

These barriers show why **structured guidance and templates** matter — without them, sustainability risks being sidelined.


## Lessons for Future Courses

From these projects, several clear lessons emerged:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Keep methods lightweight", body: "Students valued templates that fit naturally into agile workflows — like adding sustainability notes into a journey map rather than a separate deliverable." },
        { title: "Link insights to backlog items", body: "Sustainability considerations need translation into user stories or non-functional requirements to avoid being forgotten." },
        { title: "Support ecological thinking", body: "Educators should provide examples of energy, material, and resource impacts in software to help students go beyond vague 'green' ideas." },
        { title: "Encourage reflection, not perfection", body: "Even partial insights made a difference; the point was starting the conversation, not producing a perfect sustainability report." }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

The iPraktikum projects showed that **students are eager to take responsibility for sustainability**, but they need **tools, confidence, and space** to do so.

The biggest takeaway? With the right support, **real-client projects can become real testbeds for sustainable software design**. Students don’t just learn to code — they learn to consider the long-term impacts of their work on people and the planet.
