## Introduction

Over the last two decades, **sustainability** has evolved from a niche concern to a guiding principle for policy, industry, and innovation.
Software sits at the heart of this shift. It can *advance sustainability goals* by enabling efficiency, inclusion, and responsible innovation — but it can also *undermine them* through resource consumption, exclusionary design, and short-term thinking.


This article unpacks the **dual role of software in sustainability**, drawing from research in my master’s thesis.

## Software as a Source of Challenges

At the same time, software development and use can *intensify sustainability problems*:

        { title: "Environmental costs", body: "The ICT sector already accounts for ~2% of global greenhouse gas emissions and up to 9% of electricity use." },

        { title: "Narrow focus on energy", body: "Industry often equates sustainability only with efficiency, neglecting broader issues like inclusion, well-being, and long-term resilience." }

## Why This Dual Role Matters

This **paradox** makes software both a *problem* and a *solution*.
For the vision of *Industry 5.0* — a human-centered, sustainability-oriented future — to succeed, professionals need to:

        { title: "Embed sustainability early", body: "Impacts are locked in during the design phase, where proactive choices can have long-term benefits." },
        { title: "Go beyond green IT", body: "Shift from narrow efficiency gains toward holistic approaches balancing equity, resilience, and responsibility." }
    ]}
/>


## Conclusion

Software is not neutral. It **shapes the way we live, work, and interact** — and with that comes responsibility.
By understanding its double role, we can move from fragmented efforts toward a systemic approach where digital innovation truly serves people and the planet.

The challenge is clear: *build software not just for functionality, but for sustainability.*
