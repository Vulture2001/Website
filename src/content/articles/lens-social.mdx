## Introduction

The social dimension of sustainability asks:
**How does this software affect people, relationships, and communities?**

In software engineering, this means looking beyond usability. It requires considering **equity, inclusion, trust, safety, and fairness** at every stage of design and development.

## What to Consider in the Social Dimension

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Equity", body: "Does the software distribute benefits and burdens fairly across different groups?" },
        { title: "Inclusion", body: "Does it empower diverse users and reduce barriers to participation?" },
        { title: "Trust", body: "Do users feel safe and confident in how the system operates?" },
        { title: "Safety and well-being", body: "Does the software avoid harm, harassment, or exclusion?" }
    ]}
/>

These questions apply across both the micro level (a single user interaction) and the macro level (societal impacts at scale).

## First, Second, and Third Order Impacts

The social impacts of software can also be understood across three levels.

<Table
    headers={["Impact Order", "Definition", "Example in Software"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "First order",
            "Immediate effects on users when interacting with the system.",
            "Accessibility of a form, clarity of consent dialogs, safety of password management."
        ],
        [
            "Second order",
            "Changes in user behavior or group dynamics enabled by the system.",
            "Algorithmic ranking that shapes what content users see; visibility of some groups over others; harassment in comment sections."
        ],
        [
            "Third order",
            "Long-term societal and cultural effects of widespread software use.",
            "Shifts in how people communicate, the rise of misinformation ecosystems, changes in norms of trust and identity."
        ]
    ]}
/>

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "First order", body: "Consider inclusivity and fairness in direct interactions — forms, accessibility, defaults, and visibility." },
        { title: "Second order", body: "Look at how features change group behaviors — amplification, bias, or harassment risks." },
        { title: "Third order", body: "Reflect on broader societal changes — norms of communication, democracy, cultural representation." }
    ]}
/>

## When to Apply the Social Lens

Here are moments in the design and development process where the social dimension is particularly important:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Requirement gathering", body: "Engage diverse stakeholders and consider groups who may otherwise be left out." },
        { title: "Interface design", body: "Check for accessibility, inclusivity, and clear consent mechanisms." },
        { title: "Algorithm design", body: "Consider bias, transparency, and fairness in ranking or recommendation systems." },
        { title: "Community features", body: "Anticipate risks of harassment, misinformation, or exclusion." },
        { title: "Product governance", body: "Set up feedback, reporting, and accountability structures." }
    ]}
/>

## Example: Social Lens on a Short-Form Video App

Imagine applying the social lens to a video sharing platform.

<Table
    headers={["Feature", "First Order Impact", "Second Order Impact", "Third Order Impact"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "Captions",
            "Directly improve accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing users.",
            "Encourage more inclusive content creation and consumption.",
            "Normalize captioning as an expectation across digital platforms."
        ],
        [
            "Algorithmic feed",
            "Determines what content a user sees immediately.",
            "Shapes visibility of some creators over others, reinforcing bias or popularity loops.",
            "Influences cultural trends and public discourse on a global scale."
        ],
        [
            "Comment system",
            "Users can give feedback and interact with creators.",
            "Risk of harassment, trolling, and exclusion in group dynamics.",
            "Alters social norms about civility, discourse, and trust in online spaces."
        ]
    ]}
/>

This shows how even small design choices carry long-term social consequences.

## Why the Social Dimension Matters

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Equity and fairness", body: "Software can either reinforce existing inequalities or help reduce them." },
        { title: "Trust and safety", body: "Social impacts determine whether people feel safe, respected, and confident in using a system." },
        { title: "Cultural influence", body: "Software shapes communication, identity, and even democracy — making social impacts impossible to ignore." }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

The social dimension reminds us that software is not just technical — it is deeply human.
Every design choice has consequences for equity, inclusion, trust, and community well-being.

For software engineering students, the key takeaway is: **always ask who benefits, who is excluded, and how this changes society over time.**

By applying the social lens alongside the environmental one, we can design systems that are not only efficient but also just and inclusive.
