## Introduction

As a student exploring design, product development, or UX, you may think of your work in terms of usability, aesthetics, or performance. But there’s more: sustainability and responsibility are increasingly essential dimensions.

The **SUX Network** (Sustainable UX Network) has built a growing collection of tools, principles, and resources aimed at helping designers integrate sustainability into every stage of UX/product design. This article walks you through what those resources include, how they are organized, and how you can use them in your coursework or design projects.

## What’s in the SUX Network Resource Collection

    items={[
        { title: "Principles & Mindset Foundations", body: "Items like “What is SUX and why we should care” and the “11 Principles of Sustainable UX” help you frame **why** sustainable UX matters — not just how to do it." },
        { title: "Tools & Templates by Design Phase", body: "They provide practical resources sorted by design phases: discovery, ideation, definition, UI design, testing, etc., making it easy to pick tools relevant to your current stage." },
        { title: "Workshops & Mapping Tools", body: "Templates such as SDG Mapping, Actor Mapping, Excluded Users Mapping, and Sustainable User Journey Mapping let you analyze your product’s impacts analytically." },
        { title: "Non-User / Non-Human Personas & Negative Impacts", body: "Tools for understanding how design choices affect people beyond direct users — other stakeholders, ecosystems, non-humans, etc. Helps broaden your design lens." },
        { title: "Responsible AI Canvas & Ethical Considerations", body: "Resources to help you think critically about AI, ethics, unintended consequences, and trade-offs when using new technology." }

        { title: "11 Principles of Sustainable UX", body: "A framework of foundational principles that guides decision-making, helping ensure sustainability becomes a default, not an afterthought." },
        { title: "Needs to Consequences Mapping", body: "A method for mapping user/business needs to negative consequences, enabling early detection & mitigation of harmful impacts." },
        { title: "Excluded Users Mapping", body: "Helps identify those who may be marginalized or excluded by your product so you can design inclusion from the start." },
        { title: "Carbon Brainstorming", body: "Brainstorm session template focused specifically on carbon impact—useful if your project touches infrastructure, deployment, or heavy computation." },
        { title: "Responsible AI Canvas", body: "A canvas that helps you assess where AI might introduce bias, ethical issues, or trade-offs so that you can plan responsibly." }

## Why This Matters for You as a Student

    items={[
        { title: "Design with impact in mind", body: "Using these resources helps you plan for sustainability, not just after building but during ideation and user research." },
        { title: "Develop systems thinking", body: "The tools push you to consider not just the user, but all actors affected — non-users, ecosystems, etc. This leads to more thoughtful, resilient design." },
        { title: "Space for trade-offs and ethical thinking", body: "Some features—or choices—you make may improve usability but harm sustainability or inclusion. These frameworks help you identify and balance trade-offs." },
        { title: "Skill building & portfolio advantage", body: "Being able to show in your portfolio that you understand sustainability, ethical design, and responsible technology will differentiate your work." }

## Conclusion

The SUX Network’s resource collection does more than provide checklists or tips — it helps shift your mindset. For you as students, it's a toolkit for weaving sustainability into everything you do: from how you plan a project, to who you test with, to the design decisions you choose.

Next time you start a design or tech project, try using one or more of these tools. It might change not just what you build, but *how* you build it — in a more conscious, responsible, and sustainable way.
