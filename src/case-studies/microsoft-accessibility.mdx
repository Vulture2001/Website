## Introduction

As students preparing for careers in technology, it’s important to see sustainability not only as an environmental or economic issue but also as a **social responsibility**. Accessibility is central to that responsibility. It ensures that people of all abilities can participate fully in education, work, and society.

Microsoft’s accessibility commitment is a valuable case study for you. It shows how inclusive design, assistive tools, and workplace policies can come together to create technology that truly works for everyone. Let’s explore their practices and see what you can learn and apply in your own studies and future careers.

## Key Sustainable Practices You Should Notice

        { title: "Challenge", body: "Imagine you’re presenting slides to your class. For students with vision impairments, following the slides may be difficult, and screen readers might not capture everything." },
        { title: "Solution", body: "PowerPoint Live allows your audience to adjust slides to their needs—scaling text, using high contrast, or connecting with a screen reader. This is the kind of feature you could evaluate or design in your own coursework." },
        { title: "Impact", body: "Students with diverse needs can engage equally, the presenter doesn’t have to worry about excluding anyone, and the whole classroom benefits from more inclusive technology." }
