## Introduction

If you are studying software engineering, computer science, or environmental tech, it is not enough to make software that *works*. Sustainable software must also be conscious of its environmental impact. Microsoft’s whitepaper on carbon-aware computing explores how software execution can be adapted — in time and location — to leverage cleaner energy, thereby reducing carbon emissions.

This article will walk you through what carbon-aware computing means, how Microsoft and partners implemented it, and what you as students can take away for your own work.

## Key Sustainable Practices from Microsoft’s Carbon-Aware Computing

        { title: "Location-Aware Execution", body: "Running parts of computation in regions where the grid is cleaner, or dynamically moving workloads to such locations to reduce emissions." },
        { title: "Open-Source Tooling & SDKs", body: "Microsoft and its partners released tools (such as the carbon-aware-sdk) that developers can use to integrate carbon awareness into their applications." }

## Case Study: UBS Advanced Compute Quantum Analytics (ACQA) Platform

    items={[
        { title: "Challenge", body: "UBS had computations in their ACQA platform that consumed energy without consideration of when or where energy was cleanest. That led to unnecessary carbon emissions." },
        { title: "Solution", body: "They partnered with Microsoft and others to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using the SCI metric, the carbon-aware SDK, and scheduling logic that shifts compute to cleaner times and places." },
        { title: "Outcome", body: "The system now can reduce carbon emissions by running tasks when grid carbon intensity is lower; it also uses regions with cleaner energy for some workload shifts. This results in measurable emissions reductions for that platform." }

## Conclusion

Microsoft’s whitepaper on carbon-aware computing pushes the idea that sustainability isn’t just about static optimization (making code faster or more efficient), but about dynamic operation: using knowledge of energy sources, time, and geography to reduce carbon footprint.
