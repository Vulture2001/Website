## Introduction

As students, you often think of software in terms of apps, websites, or user experiences. But software also plays a critical role in **sustainability**: helping industries optimize processes, cut emissions, and empower users to make greener choices.

Here we look at two cases: **Vasconia Group in Mexico**, which used AI and big data to reduce industrial emissions, and **Copec S.A. in Chile**, which developed apps to promote environmental protection and clean mobility.

## Case Study 1: Vasconia Group and AI-Driven Process Optimization

    items={[
        { title: "Challenge", body: "Aluminum production is energy-intensive and typically generates high carbon emissions." },
        { title: "Solution", body: "Vasconia Group integrated big data and artificial intelligence tools (via the Beyond Alea platform) to monitor and optimize industrial processes in their Veracruz plant." },
        { title: "Impact", body: "They achieved an 84% reduction in the carbon intensity of raw materials—from 9.39 tCO₂e per ton in 2019 to just 1.46 tCO₂e in 2021." }

**Lesson for students**: AI and analytics aren’t just for tech companies; they can be applied in traditional industries to cut emissions and drive sustainable innovation.

## Case Study 2: Copec S.A. and Sustainability Apps

    items={[
        { title: "Challenge", body: "Chile faces environmental risks like forest fires and the need to support adoption of electric vehicles (EVs)." },
        { title: "Solution", body: "Copec launched apps such as Wood Tracking (to detect and prevent forest fires) and Terpel Voltex (to help EV users plan routes and charging)." },
        { title: "Impact", body: "These digital tools improved environmental protection and removed barriers for sustainable mobility, supporting Chile’s energy transition." }
    ]}
/>

**Lesson for students**: Mobile apps can go beyond convenience—they can address urgent environmental problems and empower users to act sustainably.


## Conclusion

These cases show how software—whether **AI-driven platforms in heavy industry** or **apps for environmental protection and clean mobility**—can play a pivotal role in sustainability.
