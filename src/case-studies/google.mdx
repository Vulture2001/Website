## Introduction

As students preparing for roles in design, engineering, or business, you’ll encounter choices about **who you design for**. Historically, tech products often failed to serve underrepresented users—from cameras that misrepresented darker skin tones to health devices that gave inaccurate readings for some populations.

Google’s journey, led by Annie Jean-Baptiste and the Product Inclusion & Equity (PI&E) team, shows how a company can evolve to make equity and inclusion a **core part of product development**. This case study offers you lessons in sustainable, equitable design that you can apply to your own academic projects and future careers.
