## Introduction

When people hear “sustainable software,” they often think only about *green IT* or energy efficiency.
But sustainability in software engineering is **much broader**.

<Quote>
    The <em>Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design</em> identifies five key dimensions that must be considered together: environmental, social, economic, technical, and individual.

This article breaks down each of these dimensions and explains why they matter for software professionals, educators, and industry leaders.

## The Five Dimensions of Sustainability

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Environmental", body: "Covers long-term effects of human activity on ecosystems — from reducing energy consumption to minimizing e-waste and supporting biodiversity." },
        { title: "Social", body: "Focuses on equity, inclusion, trust, and ethical use of technology, ensuring software empowers rather than excludes communities." },
        { title: "Economic", body: "Ensures that digital products create value and remain financially viable over time without sacrificing other sustainability goals." },
        { title: "Technical", body: "Addresses maintainability, adaptability, and resilience — building systems that can evolve without accumulating crippling technical debt." },
        { title: "Individual", body: "Centers on well-being, autonomy, and personal growth of the people directly interacting with or affected by software systems." }

## Why They Matter Together

No single dimension is enough on its own. For example:

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Trade-offs exist", body: "A highly efficient app (environmental) may still exclude users with disabilities (social)." },
        { title: "Systemic impacts", body: "Software that improves financial viability (economic) but increases technical fragility (technical) risks collapse over time." },
        { title: "Human element", body: "Even the greenest system is not sustainable if it harms individual well-being or mental health (individual)." }
    ]}
/>

The real challenge is **balancing all five dimensions** and recognizing how decisions in one area ripple across the others.

## Linking Dimensions to Impact Orders

The Karlskrona Manifesto also distinguishes three *orders of impact*:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "First order", body: "Direct effects of running software — such as electricity consumed by servers or devices." },
        { title: "Second order", body: "Changes in behavior or practices enabled by software — for instance, teleconferencing replacing business flights." },
        { title: "Third order", body: "Long-term systemic changes — such as shifting entire industries toward digital-first and remote work." }
    ]}
/>

These orders of impact cut across all five dimensions, reminding us that **software influences both the micro and macro scale** of sustainability.

## Conclusion

Sustainability in software engineering is **multidimensional**.
It is not just about energy efficiency, but about designing systems that respect the environment, empower society, remain economically viable, stay technically resilient, and protect individual well-being.
