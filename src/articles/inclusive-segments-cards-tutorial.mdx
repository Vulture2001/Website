## Introduction

When we design software only for the ‚Äúaverage user,‚Äù we leave many people behind. Real users differ in their abilities, resources, and backgrounds. Some rely on assistive technologies, some live with unstable internet, and others face cultural or language barriers.

**Inclusive User Groups** give students a way to capture this diversity in a structured way. They help you think about equity, privilege, and accessibility in practical terms ‚Äî and then turn those reflections into design actions.

This article explains what each section of the template means, how to use it in projects, and includes a worked example.


## The Inclusive User Groups Template

## How to Use the Template in Figma

We‚Äôve prepared a digital version of the template so you can use it directly in workshops or assignments.

## What Each Section Means

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "User Group Data", body: "Start with facts about the group (age, abilities, background, financial safety). Base everything on sources, not stereotypes." },
        { title: "Wheel of Power", body: "Reflect on privileges this group has or lacks ‚Äî such as access to resources, technical expertise, or influence on decisions." },
        { title: "Role", body: "Describe the group‚Äôs role in relation to the product (e.g., daily users, testers, decision-makers)." },
        { title: "Needs & Pains", body: "Identify barriers they face ‚Äî lack of access, poor usability, or missing features." },
        { title: "Gains", body: "Note positive outcomes they could achieve if the design works well for them." },
        { title: "User Story", body: "Summarize as: ‚ÄòAs a [role], I want [needs/pains], so that [gains].‚Äô" }

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Step 1 ‚Äî Choose a group", body: "Pick a user group relevant to your project, or create a new one." },
        { title: "Step 2 ‚Äî Fill in data", body: "Use real sources where possible. Avoid assumptions and stereotypes." },
        { title: "Step 3 ‚Äî Reflect on privilege", body: "Check the Wheel of Power and ask: where is this group advantaged or disadvantaged?" },
        { title: "Step 4 ‚Äî Map role, needs, and gains", body: "Write down their role in the system, what they need, and what value they can gain." },
        { title: "Step 5 ‚Äî Create a user story", body: "Turn the insights into a simple, actionable story to guide design." }
    ]}

## Example: Applying Inclusive User Groups to a Learning App

Imagine you are designing a mobile app for online learning. You pick three Inclusive User Groups to guide your design.

### Step 1 ‚Äî Choose groups

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Low-bandwidth learners", body: "Students in rural areas with unstable internet." },
        { title: "Screen reader users", body: "Learners who rely on assistive technology." },
        { title: "First-generation students", body: "Learners with limited financial safety and less access to mentoring." }
    ]}
/>

### Step 2 ‚Äî Fill the groups

<Table
    headers={["Group", "Needs", "Barriers", "Gains", "User Story"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "Low-bandwidth learners",
            "Efficient streaming, offline access.",
            "High data use, app crashes on weak signals.",
            "Affordable learning even with limited internet.",
            "As a learner with poor internet, I want offline access so I can keep up with classes."
        ],
        [
            "Screen reader users",
            "Accessible labels, text alternatives.",
            "Unlabeled buttons, inaccessible math articles.",
            "Equal access to articles and tasks.",
            "As a blind learner, I want clear screen reader labels so I can navigate lessons independently."
        ],
        [
            "First-generation students",
            "Clear guidance, affordable resources.",
            "Complex instructions, high costs.",
            "Confidence and progress without hidden obstacles.",
            "As a first-generation student, I want simple, affordable access so I can complete my studies successfully."
        ]
    ]}
/>

### Step 3 ‚Äî Translate to actions

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Offline-first design", body: "Lessons downloadable under 20 MB with sync on Wi-Fi." },
        { title: "Accessibility by default", body: "All interactive elements labeled and tested with screen readers." },
        { title: "Affordable access", body: "Provide a free tier or low-cost options for first-generation students." }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

Inclusive User Groups help you **design with equity in mind**. They connect user diversity, privilege reflection, and accessibility into a clear workflow.

By adding this tool to your design process, you can move from broad ideals of inclusion to **specific design choices** that make software fairer and more usable for everyone.
