## Introduction

Software is never neutral. Every product reflects decisions about who it serves, who it excludes, and whose needs are prioritised.

The **Power Wheel** is a tool to reflect on **privilege and marginalisation**. It maps how certain characteristics — such as gender, ethnicity, ability, or income — can influence people’s access to resources, opportunities, and participation in digital systems.

For software engineering students, the Power Wheel is a lens to ask:  
**Who benefits from this design, and who is left out?**

## How the Power Wheel Works

    items={[
        { title: "Privilege at the centre", body: "Groups with more power and access are positioned near the centre of the wheel." },
        { title: "Marginalisation at the edges", body: "Groups with less access or fewer rights are pushed outward." },
        { title: "Dynamic and contextual", body: "Privilege is not fixed — it changes across cultures, contexts, and intersections (e.g., being both a woman and a migrant)." }

By visualising privilege and oppression, the Power Wheel helps design teams challenge assumptions and make invisible exclusions visible.

## Who is Marginalised?

Many groups are systematically excluded or disadvantaged in digital systems. Here are some examples:

<Table
    headers={["Group", "Description", "Examples of Exclusion"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "Ethnic minorities",
            "People marginalised based on origin, skin colour, or ethnicity.",
            "Discrimination in online platforms, such as reports of hosts rejecting guests based on race."
        ],
        [
            "Women",
            "Historically less access to resources and power, leading to inequality.",
            "Health apps that ignore menstrual tracking, despite billions of affected users."
        ],
        [
            "LGBTQ+ community",
            "Individuals with non-heteronormative orientations or identities facing discrimination.",
            "Navigation systems misgendering users or excluding non-binary identities."
        ],
        [
            "People with disabilities",
            "Individuals with physical or mental impairments encountering barriers.",
            "Scooter-sharing apps inaccessible for those with mobility or vision challenges."
        ],
        [
            "Low socio-economic status",
            "People facing poverty or social exclusion due to economic disadvantage.",
            "Cashless-only businesses excluding individuals without bank access or credit cards."
        ]

## Why the Power Wheel Matters for Software Design

    items={[
        { title: "Reveals hidden privilege", body: "Most design teams are not neutral — their own backgrounds influence what gets built." },
        { title: "Surfaces marginalisation", body: "By naming excluded groups, the Power Wheel prevents them from being forgotten." },
        { title: "Guides inclusive design", body: "It helps teams turn abstract ideas of fairness into concrete design choices." }

## Conclusion

The Power Wheel is not just a diagram — it is a **critical reflection tool**. It shows that privilege and marginalisation are baked into the systems we design.

For software engineers, the key is to ask:
- *Who is at the centre of this design?*
- *Who is pushed to the margins?*

By recognising these dynamics, we can design digital products that are not only functional, but also fair, inclusive, and responsible.
