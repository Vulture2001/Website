## Introduction

Every line of code we write has ripple effects: on individuals, on communities, and on the planet.
Yet in software engineering, we often focus only on functionality, deadlines, and performance.

<Callout variant="tip" title="What are Conscious Digital Product Principles?">
    They are not strict rules, but guiding values that help teams ask better questions, make more ethical choices, and consider the *systemic, societal, and environmental impacts* of their work.

This article introduces five principles and explains how to apply them in student projects and professional practice.

## The Five Principles

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Transparency", body: "Make data flows, algorithms, and decision logic visible. Users, communities, and stakeholders should know why they see certain content, how data is used, and what trade-offs are involved." },
        { title: "Accessibility & Inclusion", body: "Prioritise accessibility and design for diverse users by considering disabilities, cultural contexts, and different levels of digital literacy." },
        { title: "Sustainability & Conscious Behaviour", body: "Reduce environmental impacts through efficient infrastructure, and design features that encourage responsible, sustainable user habits." },
        { title: "Long-term Focus", body: "Think beyond short-term gains. Build maintainable systems that create lasting value without compromising the future." },
        { title: "Accountability & Systemic Responsibility", body: "Ensure clear responsibility for outcomes. Build feedback loops, reporting channels, and governance structures that take into account both individual and societal impacts." }

## Applying the Principles in Practice

Here’s how you might use the Conscious Digital Product Principles in a project setting:

<Table
    headers={["Principle", "How to Apply It", "Example in a Student Project"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "Transparency",
            "Explain algorithms and give users visibility into data practices.",
            "Add a 'Why am I seeing this?' panel in a recommendation feature."
        ],
        [
            "Accessibility & Inclusion",
            "Test designs with diverse users and accessibility tools.",
            "Ensure screen reader compatibility and captions for video tutorials."
        ],
        [
            "Sustainability & Conscious Behaviour",
            "Optimize for efficiency and avoid manipulative patterns that drive overuse.",
            "Compress images in a learning app and encourage offline modes to reduce resource use."
        ],
        [
            "Long-term Focus",
            "Plan for maintainability and future impact, not just launch deadlines.",
            "Document code and data models so future teams can extend them responsibly."
        ],
        [
            "Accountability & Systemic Responsibility",
            "Create ways for users to report harm and for teams to act on it.",
            "Include a reporting feature in a chat tool with clear moderation processes."
        ]
    ]}

## Conclusion

Conscious Digital Product Principles remind us that software is not only about technical skill but also about **values, systems, and choice**.
By embedding these principles into our projects, we move from simply *reacting* to challenges toward *proactively shaping* a sustainable and just digital future.
