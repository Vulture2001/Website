## Introduction

The environmental dimension of sustainability asks a simple but powerful question:  
**How does this software affect the planet’s resources and ecosystems?**

In software engineering, this means looking beyond just “green IT.” It requires a systemic lens: energy consumed while the software runs, emissions from the infrastructure it uses, and the broader changes it drives in society.

## What to Consider in the Environmental Dimension

    items={[
        { title: "Energy use", body: "Electricity consumed by servers, devices, and networks while software runs." },
        { title: "Hardware and materials", body: "The devices and infrastructure needed to support software, and their embodied carbon footprint." },
        { title: "Waste and end-of-life", body: "Obsolete devices, e-waste, and how quickly software drives hardware turnover." },
        { title: "Emissions", body: "Greenhouse gases produced across the lifecycle, from manufacturing to data center operations." }

These questions matter at every stage of software design and operation.

## First, Second, and Third Order Impacts

Environmental impacts of software can be understood across three levels.

<Table
    headers={["Impact Order", "Definition", "Example in Software"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "First order",
            "Direct resource use when the software runs.",
            "Electricity used to stream a video; battery drain from a mobile app; CPU cycles for a background task."
        ],
        [
            "Second order",
            "Changes in user behavior enabled by the software.",
            "Video conferencing replacing business flights (reduces emissions); autoplay encouraging longer sessions (increases emissions)."
        ],
        [
            "Third order",
            "Long-term systemic effects in society and industry.",
            "Shifts toward remote work reducing commuting; culture of constant video consumption increasing global network demand."
        ]
    ]}
/>

        { title: "First order", body: "Think about runtime efficiency, algorithms, caching, and infrastructure choices." },
        { title: "Second order", body: "Consider how your product changes user behavior in ways that increase or decrease environmental impact." },
        { title: "Third order", body: "Reflect on the bigger picture: how entire industries or lifestyles change because of your software." }
    ]}

## When to Apply the Environmental Lens

It is not always realistic to account for everything, so here are key moments when the environmental dimension should guide decisions:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Early design", body: "Choices about features, defaults, and infrastructures lock in long-term resource use." },
        { title: "Architecture and infrastructure", body: "Cloud provider, data center location, and coding efficiency directly shape first-order impacts." },
        { title: "User experience design", body: "Decisions like autoplay, preloading, and refresh frequency can multiply second-order impacts." },
        { title: "Product strategy", body: "Business models (ad-driven, subscription, open source) influence how much articles is produced, consumed, and stored — shaping third-order impacts." }
    ]}
/>

## Example: Environmental Lens on a Messaging App

Imagine applying the environmental lens to a simple group chat app.

<Table
    headers={["Phase", "First Order Impact", "Second Order Impact", "Third Order Impact"]}
    rows={[
        [
            "Message sending",
            "Energy used by device radios and data center routing.",
            "Encourages short, frequent messages, increasing traffic.",
            "Shifts cultural norms from email to constant, energy-intensive micro-communication."
        ],
        [
            "Image sharing",
            "High data use for sending images and videos.",
            "More sharing because of frictionless uploads.",
            "Increased demand for cloud storage and long-term data retention."
        ],
        [
            "Notifications",
            "Device wakes up, draining battery repeatedly.",
            "Pushes users to check phones more often.",
            "Creates expectations of 24/7 availability and device dependency."
        ]
    ]}
/>

This shows how even simple features can add up across the three orders of impact.

## Why the Environmental Dimension Matters

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Planetary limits", body: "The ICT sector already accounts for around 2–4% of global greenhouse gas emissions." },
        { title: "Hidden costs", body: "Small design choices like autoplay or preloading can multiply resource use at scale." },
        { title: "Systemic influence", body: "Software does not just use energy — it shapes behaviors, industries, and infrastructure demand." }
    ]}

## Conclusion

The environmental dimension reminds us that software is not weightless.  
Every feature has an ecological footprint, from energy use today to systemic effects decades later.

For software engineering students, the lesson is clear: **design with the planet in mind.** Ask at each stage — *what are the first, second, and third order impacts of this decision?*

By using this lens, we can move beyond small efficiency fixes toward systemic responsibility, ensuring that the digital world supports — rather than undermines — a sustainable future.
