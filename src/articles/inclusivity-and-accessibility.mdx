## Introduction

In software engineering, terms like *inclusivity* and *accessibility* are often used together. They overlap, but they are not the same.

<Callout variant="info" title="Accessibility">
    Accessibility is about ensuring that people with specific needs, such as disabilities, can use your product effectively.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="info" title="Inclusivity">
    Inclusivity is about going further — designing in a way that values and welcomes the diversity of all users, across culture, language, background, and context.
</Callout>




Both are essential for building digital products that serve people fairly.

## What is Accessibility?

    items={[
        { title: "Definition", body: "Accessibility means making sure that people with disabilities or specific constraints can use your product without barriers." },
        { title: "Focus", body: "Practical accommodations, like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, captions, and color contrast." },
        { title: "Why it matters", body: "Accessibility is often a legal requirement and ensures equal access to digital services." }

## What is Inclusivity?

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Definition", body: "Inclusivity means designing software so that diverse groups of people feel considered, respected, and supported." },
        { title: "Focus", body: "Broader than accessibility — includes culture, language, economic background, gender, age, and levels of digital literacy." },
        { title: "Why it matters", body: "Inclusivity ensures that no group is left behind and that products feel fair and welcoming to everyone." }

## Conclusion

Accessibility and inclusivity are two sides of the same coin. Accessibility focuses on removing barriers for specific groups. Inclusivity makes sure everyone feels considered, regardless of culture, ability, or background.
