## Introduction

In software engineering, **prototyping** is often seen as a way to speed up design or get quick feedback on user interfaces. But its role is much deeper.
Prototyping is a **learning activity**: it helps teams surface assumptions, test alternative paths, and understand both user needs and systemic impacts before committing resources.

This article explores different dimensions of prototyping and explains why it is central to sustainable and responsible software engineering.

## Why Prototype?

        { title: "Expose hidden impacts", body: "By simulating workflows, prototypes reveal potential ecological or social consequences before real systems are built." },
        { title: "Enable participation", body: "Prototypes allow diverse stakeholders — including marginalized groups — to see and critique ideas, not just abstract documents." },
        { title: "Fail safely", body: "Exploring bad ideas in a low-cost prototype avoids expensive mistakes in code, infrastructure, or policy." },
        { title: "Accelerate learning", body: "Each iteration builds shared understanding across designers, developers, and stakeholders." }

## Types of Prototypes

Not all prototypes look alike. They vary in fidelity, purpose, and audience.

    items={[
        { title: "Low-fidelity", body: "Paper sketches, wireframes, or click-through mockups. Fast, cheap, and great for exploring broad concepts." },
        { title: "Medium-fidelity", body: "Interactive mockups or partial implementations. Useful for testing specific interactions or data flows." },
        { title: "High-fidelity", body: "Close-to-final designs or coded experiments. Best for validating technical feasibility, performance, or integration issues." }
    ]}
/>

Each type of prototype offers a different balance of speed, detail, and risk reduction.



## Conclusion

Prototyping is not just about validating usability — it is a **strategic tool for sustainability**. It helps teams learn quickly, include diverse perspectives, and prevent negative impacts before they are baked into the system.
