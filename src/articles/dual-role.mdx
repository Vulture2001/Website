## Introduction

Over the last two decades, **sustainability** has evolved from a niche concern to a guiding principle for policy, industry, and innovation.
Software sits at the heart of this shift. It can *advance sustainability goals* by enabling efficiency, inclusion, and systemic change — but it can also *undermine them* through resource consumption, exclusionary design, and short-term thinking.

    This article unpacks the **double role of software in sustainability** — both as a driver of innovation and as a source of ecological and social risks.

## Software as a Driver of Sustainability

Software can actively support sustainability by reducing environmental impacts, enabling new practices, and fostering equity. Examples include:

        { title: "Enabling sustainable practices", body: "Digital tools support businesses and individuals in tracking carbon footprints, optimizing resources, and reducing waste." },
        { title: "Supporting social equity", body: "Inclusive and accessible design empowers diverse users and reduces digital exclusion." },
        { title: "Shaping systemic change", body: "From telemedicine to smart energy grids, software enables large-scale transitions toward more sustainable systems." }

## Software as a Source of Challenges

At the same time, software development and use can *intensify sustainability problems*.
Key risks include:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Environmental costs", body: "The ICT sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions and electricity use, with impacts expected to rise as digital demand grows." },
        { title: "Social risks", body: "Poorly designed AI and digital systems can reproduce bias, erode trust, and exclude vulnerable groups." },
        { title: "Technical debt & short-termism", body: "Fast release cycles often prioritize speed over maintainability, creating fragile systems that are costly and unsustainable over time." },
        { title: "Narrow focus on efficiency", body: "Industry debates often equate sustainability only with energy efficiency, neglecting broader issues like inclusion, well-being, and long-term resilience." }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

Software is not neutral. It **shapes the way we live, work, and interact** — and with that comes responsibility.
By recognizing its double role, we can move from fragmented efforts toward a systemic approach where digital innovation truly serves people and the planet.
