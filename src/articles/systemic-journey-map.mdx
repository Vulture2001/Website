## Introduction

In student projects, it’s easy to focus on **features, sprints, and deadlines**. But software also has **hidden impacts**: it uses energy, influences behavior, and can include or exclude people.

The **Systemic Journey Map** is a lightweight tool to surface those impacts. It looks like a normal journey map, but with **two extra rows**:
🌍 *Environmental impact* and 👥 *Social impact*.

This guide walks you step by step through using the map, with a concrete example at the end.

## The Systemic Journey Map Template

👉 We prepared a ready-to-use template in Figma:

## What the Rows Mean

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Journey Phases", body: "The main steps of the experience (e.g., onboarding, everyday use, end-of-life)." },
        { title: "User Actions", body: "What people actually do at each step." },
        { title: "User Goals", body: "What they want to achieve." },
        { title: "Pain Points / Needs", body: "What frustrates them." },
        { title: "Gains", body: "What works well or adds value." },
        { title: "Environmental Impact", body: "Energy, bandwidth, device storage, material use." },
        { title: "Social Impact", body: "Inclusion, fairness, safety, accessibility, well-being." },
        { title: "Data / Other Notes", body: "Privacy, governance, or things that don’t fit elsewhere." }
    ]}
/>

You can also **classify impacts** to see how deep they go:

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "First order", body: "Direct effects (battery drain, server load)." },
        { title: "Second order", body: "Behavioral effects (scrolling longer, changing habits)." },
        { title: "Third order", body: "System-level shifts (how an app changes culture or infrastructure)." }
    ]}
/>

👉 Don’t stress if you can’t think of third-order effects at first — even spotting first-order impacts is already useful.

## Step-by-Step: How to Use It

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Step 1 — Define scope", body: "Pick the feature or product you want to map. List the main users and stakeholders." },
        { title: "Step 2 — Map the basic journey", body: "Fill in phases, actions, goals, pains, and gains." },
        { title: "Step 3 — Add environmental and social rows", body: "Brainstorm resource use and social effects for each phase." },
        { title: "Step 4 — Classify impacts", body: "Mark them as first, second, or third order." },
        { title: "Step 5 — Spot opportunities", body: "Highlight where you could reduce harm or add positive impact." },
        { title: "Step 6 — Turn into actions", body: "Write backlog items, requirements, or design changes based on what you found." }
    ]}
/>

👉 The goal isn’t perfection — it’s sparking discussion in your team and making sure sustainability doesn’t get forgotten.

## Example: A Short-Form Video App

Let’s say your team is building a short-form video app (like TikTok). Here’s how students might apply the SJM.

### Step 1 — Scope and Stakeholders

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Scope", body: "Mobile app from install to account deletion." },
        { title: "Primary stakeholders", body: "Viewers, creators, moderators." },
        { title: "Secondary stakeholders", body: "Families, advertisers, cultural groups, network providers, environment." }
    ]}
/>

### Step 2 — Core Phases

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Install & onboarding", body: "Download, account setup, consent." },
        { title: "Feed consumption", body: "Scrolling, autoplay, reactions." },
        { title: "Creation & upload", body: "Recording, editing, publishing." },
        { title: "Sharing & interaction", body: "Comments, duets, private messages." },
        { title: "Downtime", body: "Breaks, reminders, ending sessions." },
        { title: "End-of-life", body: "Account deletion, data removal." }
    ]}
/>

### Step 3 — Environmental & Social Layers

<Table
    headers={["Phase", "Environmental Impact", "Social Impact"]}
    rows={[
        ["Install & onboarding", "Network transfer, app updates.", "Form accessibility, parental controls, clarity of consent."],
        ["Feed consumption", "Continuous streaming, high-bitrate defaults.", "Addictive scrolling, algorithmic bias, missing captions."],
        ["Creation & upload", "Energy for editing and processing.", "Harassment risks, barriers for marginalized creators."],
        ["Sharing & interaction", "Extra load from notifications.", "Privacy concerns, misinformation, cultural sensitivity."],
        ["Downtime", "Background refresh drains energy.", "Sleep disruption, excessive screen time."],
        ["End-of-life", "Cached files and cloud storage.", "Hard-to-delete accounts, unclear data removal."]
    ]}
/>

### Step 4 — Impact Orders

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "First order", body: "Energy use, notifications draining battery." },
        { title: "Second order", body: "Users spend more time due to autoplay; comment culture shifts." },
        { title: "Third order", body: "Attention economy effects, infrastructure demand for video." }
    ]}
/>

### Step 5 — Opportunities

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Ecological", body: "Adaptive video quality, reduce background refresh, compress cached media." },
        { title: "Social", body: "Auto-enable captions, break reminders, transparent algorithms, stronger safety tools." }
    ]}
/>

### Step 6 — Design Actions

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Requirement", body: "Respect data-saver mode with adaptive video quality." },
        { title: "Design change", body: "Autoplay pauses after a few videos with a choice to continue." },
        { title: "Accessibility", body: "Auto-generate editable captions." },
        { title: "Transparency", body: "Add a ‘Why am I seeing this?’ button for recommendations." },
        { title: "End-of-life", body: "One-screen account deletion with instant cache removal." }
    ]}
/>

## Conclusion

For students, the **Systemic Journey Map** is a **fast, visual tool** that connects your app design with bigger questions about people and the planet.

It helps you go beyond “just features” and think about **long-term effects** — without slowing your team down.
