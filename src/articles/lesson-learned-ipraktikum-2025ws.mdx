## Introduction

If you’re about to join the **iPraktikum course at TUM**, you’ll be building real software for real clients. Previous student teams were in the same shoes and tried out sustainability methods like the **Systemic Journey Map** and **Inclusive Segment Cards** alongside agile development.

Here’s a look at what they found helpful, what was tricky, and what you can learn from their experiences.

## What Students Found Valuable

    items={[
        { title: "Raising awareness early", body: "The methods helped students realize that even small design choices can have social or ecological effects." },
        { title: "Making impacts visible", body: "Visualizing environmental and social consequences gave structure to topics that usually stay hidden." },
        { title: "Improving teamwork", body: "Thinking about accessibility and fairness together sparked useful discussions within the team and with clients." }
    ]}

👉 The big point: sustainability didn’t replace agile practices — it **added fresh perspectives** and made it easier to bring up important questions in meetings.

## Challenges Students Faced

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Ecological thinking was harder", body: "Social topics (like inclusivity) were easier to imagine, but ecological impacts often felt abstract or limited to energy use." },
        { title: "Turning insights into action", body: "Even when they saw impacts, many weren’t sure how to translate them into backlog items or code." },
        { title: "Time pressure", body: "With deadlines and client deliverables, it was tempting to set sustainability aside in favor of immediate features." }
    ]}
/>

👉 So don’t worry if you don’t “get it right” immediately — many teams struggled with the same things.

## Lessons for You

Here are some takeaways from past teams that can help you in your own project:

    items={[
        { title: "Turn insights into backlog items", body: "Write down sustainability considerations as user stories or requirements so they don’t get lost." },
        { title: "Ask for concrete examples", body: "Look at cases of energy use, materials, or resource impacts in software — this makes ecological thinking less abstract." },
        { title: "Reflect, don’t aim for perfection", body: "It’s more important to start the conversation than to deliver a perfect sustainability report." }
    ]}
/>

👉 Even small steps can change how your team and client think about sustainability.

## Conclusion

Previous iPraktikum students showed that **you don’t just learn to code — you learn to think about the bigger picture**.

Take the chance to experiment, bring in new perspectives, and see how your design choices might shape people and the planet in the long run.
