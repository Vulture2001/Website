## The Problem

Digital platforms are engineered as "attention slot machines". They are using persuasive designs to trigger subconscious and mindless scrolling. We get sucked into a cycle where our focus is sold for profit, leaving us feeling like we're just reacting to screens instead of making our own choices. Users are left trapped in reactive habits, losing hours of their day to a system that prioritizes engagement over human well-being.

## The Goal

TrueGram shifts the metric of success from "Time Spent" to Quality Time. Our goal is to replace mindless consumption with conscious interaction, ensuring every minute spent on your device is intentional. By redesigning the digital entry point, we empower users to break free from the loop and reclaim their time for the things that actually matter.

## Impact

<Callout variant="success" title="Mission">
TrueGram halts the psychological drain of endless scrolling and cultivates digital mindfulness. By replacing algorithmic coercion with human intention, we empower young adults to reclaim ownership of their time, focus, and emotional wellbeing.

## Solution Overview

TrueGram redefines the social media architecture through four core pillars of conscious design:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Intent-Based Feed", body: "Disrupts the automatic habit of opening the app by requiring users to select a goal, such as \"Catch Up\", \"Find Inspiration\", or \"Post\" before entering the feed." },
        { title: "No Endless Scroll", body: "Eliminates the \"bottomless bowl\" effect. Each session is controlled by a timer that provides a clear stopping cue, helping users maintain intentional browsing habits." },
        { title: "Notification Bundles", body: "Replaces anxiety-inducing real-time pings with scheduled batches. Users decide when they want to be notified, reducing cognitive load and constant interruption." },
        { title: "Check-In & Check-Out", body: "Integrates mindfulness via a non-oppressive survey. Users track their energy and focus levels before and after usage to build awareness of digital impact." },
    ]}
/>

## The Designed Experience

TrueGram's design goal is to make being online feel calm, easy, and empowering. Every element was consciously developed to help users regain control over their focus, particularly those most vulnerable.

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Visual Identity", body: "The look is minimalist, calm, and focused. A palette of muted, earthy tones paired with subtle, slow animations reduces visual stress and avoids the high-stimulation triggers typical of addictive apps. There are no flashing notifications or bright attention-grabbing elements." },
        { title: "Conscious Interaction", body: "TrueGram introduces Conscious Friction as a core principle. Intent Prompts require users to define their purpose before entering the feed. Notification Bundles collect updates and deliver them at scheduled times, reducing constant interruption and maintaining intentionality." },
        { title: "Emotional Design", body: "Check-In and Check-Out surveys help users reflect on their mood and energy before and after scrolling, building awareness of how social media affects them over time. The interface avoids guilt-tripping or alarming screen time reports, just gentle awareness building." },
        { title: "Product Experience", body: "A session timer provides a clear endpoint, eliminating the endless scroll. When time expires, Mindful Partners display curated, values-aligned recommendations instead of pushing users back into the feed." },
    ]}
/>

## Ethical Business Model

TrueGram is built on **Ethical Defaults**: transparent privacy and no manipulative patterns. Instead of intrusive ads, our mindful partners show curated, values-aligned recommendations only at session end, never mid-scroll.

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Mindful Partnerships", body: "We partner exclusively with brands that align with our values of sustainability and mental wellbeing. Every partner is vetted to ensure they add real value to our users' lives." },
        { title: "Session-End Placement", body: "Ads should never interrupt your flow. Partner recommendations appear only at the natural end of a session, respecting your focus and never breaking your immersion mid-scroll." },
        { title: "Context Over Surveillance", body: "We match recommendations to your declared session intent (e.g., 'Find Inspiration') rather than harvesting your personal data or behavioral history." },
        { title: "Zero-Tracking Privacy", body: "Our model relies on context, not cookies. We do not track users across the web, sell data to third parties, or build behavioral profiles." },

    Generally, all team members contributed equally to the development of our product. The Product Ideation was done as a group as well as the discussions of the Reflection Cards. For the Inclusive User Groups each team member focused on one group.
