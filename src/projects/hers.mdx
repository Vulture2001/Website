## The Problem

Women and gender-diverse people often feel unsafe in public spaces, especially when walking or using public transport. Many adapt their behavior (taking longer routes, calling someone while walking, carrying pepper spray). Cities, built largely for cars and male mobility patterns, ignore these everyday safety issues.

## The Goal
To create safer, more inclusive urban mobility by increasing both real safety and the feeling of security through collective awareness, community support, and data-driven prevention.

## Solution Overview

<FeatureList
    items={[
        { title: "Safe Routes", body: "The app guides you along the safest path, based on community feedback and real city data about lighting, traffic, and reported incidents." },
        { title: "Safety Map", body: "You can see safe and unsafe spots in your area and mark new ones yourself. Every report helps others feel safer and builds a shared awareness of risky places." },
        { title: "Alarm & Help", body: "In an emergency, you can send out a loud alarm through the app or the connected SafetyDevice. People nearby from the hers* community are alerted and can offer help. Your personal emergency contacts can also be notified automatically." },
        { title: "Community Power", body: "The hers* SafeClub is your digital support circle. It’s a place to learn, share, and exchange tips on self-defense, awareness, and mutual care." },
    ]}
/>

Together, these tools turn everyday movement into something collective and empowering. By combining personal safety, shared data, and community care, hers* transforms fear into confidence and isolation into connection.

## The Designed Experience

hers* was created with one clear goal — to make safety feel intuitive, inclusive, and empowering. Everything — from colors and icons to accessibility and emotional design — was consciously developed for people of all backgrounds and abilities.

<IconList
    items={[
        { title: "Visual Identity", body: "The look is modern, calm, and confident. A gender-neutral color palette shifts between light and dark modes for comfort day and night. Green means safety, blue feels neutral, and red signals danger — all high in contrast for visibility. Typography combines the expressive ABC Whyte with the clear SF Pro Text, creating a voice that’s bold yet approachable." },
        { title: "Inclusive Interaction", body: "Accessibility was part of the core design, not an afterthought. Users can switch languages, adjust text size, or choose left- or right-hand control. A “simple language” mode supports different reading levels, and gentle motion avoids stress. Avatars and illustrations are neutral and diverse, so everyone can find themselves in the experience." },
        { title: "Emotional Design", body: "hers* speaks in a warm, natural tone. The interface guides with empathy — no fear-based visuals, only clarity and care. Every screen encourages calm action, helping users feel safe, not watched or warned." },
        { title: "Product Experience", body: "The SafetyDevice turns the digital idea into a physical sense of safety. It fits naturally in your hand, works even without a phone, and uses simple signals — light, sound, vibration — to connect you to the community. Made from recycled materials, it reflects the same care for people and the planet that defines the whole project." },
