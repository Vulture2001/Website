## The Problem

Doctoral education in Germany shows persistent structural inequalities in access and participation. In computer science, 78% of doctoral candidates are male, and only 28% are first-generation migrants, indicating ongoing gender and migration imbalances. Social background also plays a decisive role: 16% of doctoral candidates have parents with a PhD, 47% have parents with a university degree, and 37% come from families without higher education. These figures illustrate how prior academic exposure and social background strongly influence access to doctoral studies.

Simultaneously the application process is often fragmented and inconsistent. Information about programs, funding, and requirements is spread across multiple channels, varies by department, and is communicated with differing levels of clarity. This lack of transparency reinforces unequal access and reproduces existing participation patterns.

As a result, women, first-generation migrants, and applicants from non-academic families face compounded barriers that reduce their likelihood of pursuing and completing doctoral degrees. This limits social mobility and narrows the range of perspectives in doctoral research, with broader implications for innovation and the academic system as a whole.

## The Goal

TUMApply seeks to **address structural barriers and procedural complexity in doctoral applications** by creating a **transparent, coherent, and well-supported application experience**. Its objectives are designed to improve clarity, reduce administrative inefficiencies, and support equitable participation:

<FeatureList
    items={[
        {
            title: "Timely & Equal Access to Opportunities",
            body: "Centralizes doctoral positions, funding calls, and deadlines in a single, accessible interface, reducing dependence on informal networks and ensuring that all applicants receive the same information at the same time."
        },
        {
            title: "Sustainable & Coherent Application Infrastructure",
            body: "Unifies and standardizes application requirements across departments while streamlining document handling and review processes. This reduces redundancy, paper-based workflows, and administrative overhead, supporting both environmental sustainability and long-term system maintainability."
        },
        {
            title: "Reduced Administrative Burden through Responsible Automation",
            body: "Applies rule-based automation to remove unnecessary manual steps in the application process, such as repeated document submissions, redundant communication, and unclear status checks. By minimizing avoidable user actions and system interactions, the design reduces administrative load, server activity, and energy use while maintaining transparency and human oversight."
        },
        {
            title: "Equitable Access Beyond Informal Gatekeeping",
            body: "Promotes fair participation by minimizing reliance on prior institutional knowledge, personal contacts, or insider guidance. Structured information, anonymized early review stages, and open communication formats help shift access from individual privilege to institutional responsibility."
        }

## Typical Applicant Overview

**Profile Example:**  

- **Gender / Education:** Heterosexual, educated male  
- **Age:** Approximately 31 years old  
- **Citizenship:** German  
- **Financial Situation:** Secure  
- **Background:** Comes from an academic household  

This profile represents the **implicit reference user** for whom many doctoral application systems have traditionally been beneficial. TUMApply continues to support this applicant through **efficient processes**, **clear guidance**, and **streamlined workflows**.

At the same time, TUMApply recognizes that **supporting a system primarily around the typical applicant reinforces structural exclusion**. The platform is therefore intentionally built to serve the typical user effectively, *while also providing targeted support for applicants whose needs are not fully addressed by standard academic processes*.

## Focused User Groups

<FeatureList
  items={[
    {
      title: "First-Generation Applicants",
      body: (
        <>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Often lack access to informal academic knowledge, such as how supervisors evaluate motivation letters, the differences in doctoral funding models, or which requirements are flexible versus mandatory. This can lead to early self-selection out of the process.
          <br />
          <strong>Solutions:</strong> Plain-language guidance for applications, step-by-step explanations of requirements to reduce overload, and funding literacy modules explaining contracts and scholarships.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      title: "Older Candidates and Career Switchers",
      body: (
        <>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> May question the relevance of professional experience or worry about age-related bias. Non-linear CVs are often undervalued despite reflecting valuable skills.
          <br />
          <strong>Solutions:</strong> Structured guidance that helps applicants frame professional experience in research-relevant terms, and transparent evaluation criteria that explain how non-academic experience can be considered.
        </>

    {
      title: "International Applicants",
      body: (
        <>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Face language barriers, unfamiliar academic conventions, visa requirements, and degree recognition issues, often with high stakes and limited feedback.
          <br />
          <strong>Solutions:</strong> Multilingual information and plain-language translations across key pages, contextual explanations of academic conventions, and regularly updated visa and legal guidance surfaced through the platform’s news and information sections, aligned with application milestones.

          <strong>Challenges:</strong> May experience implicit bias, limited access to academic networks, and uncertainty about belonging, even if educated locally.
          <br />
          <strong>Solutions:</strong> Anonymized early-stage review removing personal identifiers, randomized pseudonyms (e.g., “Green Penguin”), and structured, criteria-based feedback to reduce perceived arbitrariness. Clear previews of the application and evaluation process, explicit expectations at each stage, and visible signals of inclusion reinforce belonging.
        </>

      title: "Women & Non-Male Applicants in STEM",
      body: (
        <>
          <strong>Challenges:</strong> Underrepresentation and implicit bias affect confidence, evaluation outcomes, and long-term participation in STEM.
          <br />
          <strong>Solutions:</strong> Anonymized names in early-stage review to reduce bias, standardized evaluation frameworks, and visible mentoring and DEI programs throughout the application journey.
