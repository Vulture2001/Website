## The Problem
Many TUM students feel uncertain and unsupported when choosing courses before the semester begins. While TUMonline provides basic course information, it often lacks context and insights that would help students understand what a course actually is - its workload, difficulty, exam style, and how it aligns with their interests and goals. 

Among the most frequently considered factors in course selection are **personal interest (80.9%)**, **workload (68.1%)**, **exam style (48.9%)** and **experiential insights from other students (48.9%)**. This suggests that students balance formal requirements with personal motivation and peer-based information when evaluating courses.

The survey shows that **peer recommendations are widely used**, with **76.6% of students selecting friends’ or peers’ recommendations as one of several sources** they consult when choosing courses. But this can be challenging for students who are introverted, new to TUM, or lack strong social connections. As a result, course choices are often based on incomplete information or trial and error, leading to low confidence in decisions, inefficient planning across semesters, and missed opportunities to discover suitable courses within and beyond the curriculum. Notably, **over 60% of surveyed students express a preference for anonymous or non-interactive guidance**, indicating a need for inclusive alternatives to asking questions in group chats or informal networks.

## The Goal
To enable TUM students to feel confident, supported and included when choosing courses, by ensuring equal access to clear and trustworthy information and opportunities to explore courses that match their interests.
