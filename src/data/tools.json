  "overview": "User and client interviews help you collect real insights about what people do, need, and value. Talking to both clients (who set goals and constraints) and users (who actually interact with the system) reveals not only functional requirements but also social and ecological impacts.",
  "purpose": "User and client interviews help you uncover functional needs, goals, and success criteria while also surfacing social impacts (fairness, accessibility, well-being) and ecological impacts (resource use, environmental footprint). They highlight differences between client priorities and user realities, building empathy and evidence for ethical, responsible design decisions.",
